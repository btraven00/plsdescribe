This is a UMAP scatter plot showing 21 distinct, colored clusters of cells, labeled 0 through 20, organized into three main groupings in a two-dimensional space.

### Cluster Descriptions:

The clusters are spatially organized into three main groups:

*   **Left Group:** A large, dense group on the left is primarily composed of adjacent clusters **1** (orange) and **3** (dark yellow). Above them sits cluster **9** (teal), with the smaller cluster **14** (dark blue) situated between 1, 3, and 9. Extending below this group are two small, distinct clusters: **15** (light purple) and the more isolated **19** (pink).

*   **Top-Right Group:** A smaller, distinct group in the upper right consists of the large cluster **6** (light green) and the adjacent, smaller cluster **11** (light blue). A very small cluster, **17** (magenta), is located on the far-right edge of cluster 6.

*   **Center-Right Group:** This is the largest and most complex group.
    *   Its core is formed by large, overlapping clusters **0** (pink), **2** (orange-brown), and **4** (olive green).
    *   To the left of this core are clusters **5** (khaki green) and **8** (dark green).
    *   Several clusters are positioned around and between these larger masses: cluster **7** (bright green) is at the top, cluster **10** (turquoise) is at the bottom, and cluster **13** (medium blue) is in the middle.
    *   Clusters **16** (light purple) and **18** (dark pink) appear as thin, elongated bridges connecting different parts of this large group.
    *   The small cluster **12** (purple) is located between clusters 8 and 16.

Cluster **20** (red) is listed in the legend, but no corresponding points are visible in the plot.
